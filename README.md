# Book Stats Charts

Creates charts on Bookwalker displaying information about book series.

## Usage

Navigate to the series page for a series on Bookwalker (JP or global) and charts
will appear after some time. Example series pages:

- https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/169915/lazy-dungeon-master/
- https://bookwalker.jp/series/70804/list/

For Bookwalker JP, make sure it is the URL with the /list/ at the end of it.
