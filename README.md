# Better Bookwalker

### [Install](https://github.com/MarvNC/better-bookwalker/releases/latest/download/better-bookwalker.user.js)

A script that enhances Bookwalker with a better UI for viewing information about
book series on the site.

## Usage

- Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) as for a userscript
  manager (it's the best).
- [Install the script](https://github.com/MarvNC/better-bookwalker/releases/latest/download/better-bookwalker.user.js).
- Navigate to a series page on Bookwalker (JP or global) and the script will
  run, displaying information about the series and a chart of the release dates.

### [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarvNC/Book-Stats-Charts/main/release-dates.user.js)

Creates charts on Bookwalker displaying information about book series.

## Usage

Navigate to the series page for a series on Bookwalker (JP or global) and charts
will appear after some time. Example series pages:

- https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/169915/lazy-dungeon-master/
- https://bookwalker.jp/series/70804/list/

For Bookwalker JP, make sure it is the URL with the /list/ at the end of it.

## Support

This script is developed and tested on Violentmonkey; Tampermonkey should also
work fine but isn't thoroughly tested.
[Greasemonkey is not supported.](https://www.greasespot.net/2017/09/greasemonkey-4-for-users.html)
