# Book Stats Charts
 Creates charts on Bookwalker displaying information about book series.
 
## Usage
 Navigate to the series page for a series on Bookwalker (JP or global) and charts will appear after some time.
 Example series pages: 
 - https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/169915/lazy-dungeon-master/
 - https://bookwalker.jp/series/70804/list/
 
 For Bookwalker JP, make sure it is the URL with the /list/ at the end of it.
